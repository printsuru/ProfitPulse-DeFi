## Admin Access

The ProfitPulse admin panel is secured through a multi-signature wallet system that requires multiple confirmations for critical operations.

### Accessing the Admin Panel

1. Visit the admin panel URL (provided separately for security)
2. Connect your wallet (must be registered as an owner in the multi-sig wallet)
3. Authenticate using the admin verification process

### Multi-Signature Wallet

The multi-signature wallet requires a minimum of 2 out of 3 owner confirmations for any administrative action. This ensures no single person can make critical changes to the platform.

To view your multi-sig status:
1. Navigate to the "Governance" section
2. Check the "Owners" list to confirm your wallet is registered
3. Review any pending transactions that require confirmation

## Dashboard Overview

The admin dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of the platform's performance:

- **Total Value Locked (TVL)**: The total amount of BUSD deposited in the platform
- **User Statistics**: Total users, active users, and new user growth
- **Profit Distribution**: Overview of profits distributed to users
- **Liquidity Ratio**: Current ratio of available liquidity to total user balances
- **Platform Health**: System status and key performance indicators

Use the dashboard to monitor platform performance and identify any issues that require attention.

## Liquidity Management

Proper liquidity management is critical for platform stability.

### Adding Liquidity

1. Navigate to the "Liquidity Management" section
2. Click "Add Liquidity"
3. Enter the amount of BUSD to add
4. Submit the transaction for multi-sig approval
5. Once approved by the required number of owners, execute the transaction

### Monitoring Liquidity Ratio

The platform should maintain a healthy liquidity ratio (available liquidity / total user balances):
- **Optimal**: Above 30%
- **Caution**: 15-30%
- **Critical**: Below 15%

If the liquidity ratio falls below 20%, consider adding more liquidity or adjusting the withdrawal cap.

### Setting Withdrawal Cap

During periods of high withdrawal activity, you may need to set a temporary withdrawal cap:

1. Navigate to the "Liquidity Management" section
2. Click "Set Withdrawal Cap"
3. Enter the maximum withdrawal amount in BUSD
4. Submit for multi-sig approval
5. Execute once approved

Set the cap to 0 to remove any withdrawal limits.

## Contract Control

The Contract Control section allows administrators to manage key platform parameters.

### Updating Profit Rates

To modify the daily profit rates for any tier:

1. Navigate to the "Contract Control" section
2. Click "Update Profit Rate"
3. Select the tier (1-4)
4. Enter the new rate in basis points (e.g., 200 for 2%)
5. Submit for multi-sig approval
6. Execute once approved

> **Note**: Rate changes should be gradual and well-communicated to users.

### Updating Referral Rates

To modify the referral reward rates:

1. Navigate to the "Contract Control" section
2. Click "Update Referral Rate"
3. Select the level (1-3)
4. Enter the new rate in basis points
5. Submit for multi-sig approval
6. Execute once approved

### Pausing the Contract

In emergency situations, the contract can be paused:

1. Navigate to the "Contract Control" section
2. Click "Pause Contract"
3. Submit for multi-sig approval
4. Execute once approved

When paused, users cannot make deposits or withdrawals, but profit calculations continue.

To unpause, follow the same process but click "Unpause Contract".

## Earnings Distribution

The Earnings Distribution section allows monitoring and management of user profits.

### Viewing User Earnings

1. Navigate to the "Earnings Distribution" section
2. Enter a user's wallet address
3. View their investment details, profits, and referral rewards

### Profit Calculation Verification

To verify profit calculations are working correctly:

1. Select a sample of users across different tiers
2. Record their profit balances
3. Check again after 24 hours
4. Verify the increase matches the expected daily profit rate

## Governance & Security

The Governance section manages the multi-signature security system.

### Viewing Pending Transactions

1. Navigate to the "Governance" section
2. Review the "Pending Transactions" list
3. Each transaction shows the function, parameters, and current confirmation count

### Confirming Transactions

To confirm a pending transaction:

2. Sign the confirmation message in your wallet

### Executing Transactions
